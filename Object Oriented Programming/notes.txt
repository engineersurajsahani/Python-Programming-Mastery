(2) It is any real world entity which having 3 things :- 
    (a) Identity 
    (b) State / Variable / Data 
    (c) Behaviour / Function / Work / Task 

Inheritence :- 
The child class acquire the properties of parent class is called 
Inheritence.

Types Of Inheritence :- 
(1) Single Inheritence 
(2) Multilevel Inheritence 
(3) Multiple Inheritence 
(4) Hierarchical Inheritence 
(5) Hybrid Inheritence 

Method Overriding :- 
The function which is present in parent class exactly same function 
is also present in chaild class then it is called 
Method Overriding.

Polymorphism :- 
(1) Runtime Polymorphism ---> Method Overriding 
(2) Compile Time Polymorphism ---> Method Overloading

Runtime Polymorphism :- 
The function call is resolved at run time is called runtime polymorphism.
